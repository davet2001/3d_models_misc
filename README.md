# Miscelaneous 3D Models

## Desktop cable tidy

I wasn't fully satisfied with the previous cable mounts I'd tried to buy and make. Nothing was durable enough.

My use case: I deal with a lot of miscelaneous electronics development. I am frequently using multiple USB types (B, mini-B, micro-B, C) as well as sometimes needing to power things, and occassionally plug in ethernet.

For many people, a desktop hub is good enough. But then you need the wires for it on an adhoc basis, and then to put them away later. My prefered workflow is to have each type of connector wired up and ready to go, that I can just pull out and use.

So I made a semi flexible interlocking mount, that has groups of 3 cable outlets. They clip together and fit nicely onto the table. There are some rounded ends to make it look nice.

They are created in FreeCAD 1.0.0. You can customise the size of the holes using a built in parameter editor, and also the table height. In the repository, there are some 3mf files set up for 18.2mm (my table height). If your table is any different, you'll need to change this and regenerate the 3mf files.

There is also a screw hole on the back to fasten it to the table edge if needed.
